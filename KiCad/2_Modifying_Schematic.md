# STEP 2 - Modifying the Schematic

Welcome, Now that you understand some of the basics, let's make sure we can made modifications on a common file. 

Goal: Add a component connected to power net with a label and text

## Open the file

There's a folder called `kicad-tutorial` with a `.pro` file that will open in KiCad. Open that and start in the schematic. 

## Adding a Component

Add a resistor and connect it to the a power net. Do do this you can press `a` and start typring `r`. Select the component and place it on the schematic. For the power net, you can press `p` and add a `3.3V` net. Connect the two with a wire.

## Adding a Label

Now add a label to the other end of the resistor. Press `l` and type your username. Place near the resistor and add a wire. 

## Adding Text

Now add text to your area describing what you did. Press `t` and type what you did. `pull up resistor`
