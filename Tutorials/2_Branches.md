# Intermediate - Working with Branches

**Purpose**: Become familiar with the concepts of Branches and when to use them

**Task**: Learn about conventions when working with branches. Create 2 branch, switch to one, create a file, switch to second branch and change file

**Outcome**: Learning the concept of Branches and how to use them

## What are Branches?

## Naming Conventions and Structures

## Create a new branch

## Create a Second Branch

## Deleting a branch

This is possible, and very helpful for cleaning up a messy repo. However, in AERO, only leadership should be deleting branches. Create as many helpful branches as you need and be sure to follow good naming conventions to keep track of what changes are on that branch. Once you do your changes, be sure to incorporate them back to main (or another applicable branch). 

## Next Up

The next step is to merge changes from one branch to another one. See the [Next Tutorial](2_Merging_Information.md) to learn more about merging.
