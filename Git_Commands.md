# Git Commands 

## Syncing Data

**Push:**
The Push command is used to publish and save the changes you made to your code to the remote repo (on Github). This command saves your changes and makes them available to everyone else who can see the repo.

**Pull:**
The Pull command is used to bring any changes that might have been made to the repo down to your local copy. So if somebody modified the code and pushed, you would then use Pull to bring the new code to your computer for you to edit and view. 

**Commit:**
The Commit is a lot like the save button for your code. It functions in a similar manner to that of the Push command, but instead of how Push updates the repo in remote storage (on Github), the Commit command simply saves your work and doesn't make your changes available to others. So this is very helpful if you want to have your code saved locally and on the in a remote place interent, but it's not ready for implementation yet. 

## Merging Changes

**Merge:**
The Merge command allows you to apply the changes you made to code from one branch to another, it's kind of like a highway on-ramp, all of the previous code is still on the highway, you're just adding new code to what already exists. 

**Checkout** bring over a file from another file without directly merging
