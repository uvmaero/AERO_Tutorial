# Tutorials

Now, We are in the process of seting up some tutorials for everyone to try. In the "Tutorials" Folder you'll find different Tutorials to try. For this, we will not be covering how to create a repo, only using an established one. If you want to learn more (or different) information, go to the [Additional Resources](#addition-resources) section. 

# Additional Resources

This guide cannot hope to cover all the information. Here are some external tutorials and videos to get you up to speed. If you find other resources that you want to share with others, add them here (using your new knowledge of git commands!)
