<br />

Here I am modifing the file (just in my terminal editor because this is a .txt, we would use and IDE for actual code)

<br />

Now I am staging my changes with the ```git add``` command so I can then commit and push them

Finally, on Github we can see that my changes successfully pushed and can be viewed by others!
