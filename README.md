# VSCode

Be sure to checkout the tutorial on [VSCode](Tutorials/1_VSCode_GettingStarted.md). For a text editor, we will be using VSCode. You can use anything to work through these tutorials, but VSCode has support for Git and many other useful tools. 

# Common Git Commands

Here's an overview of some of the most common commands you'll be using. There is much more and this barely scratches surface, but it's a good place to start. [Git Commands](Git_Commands.md)

# Tutorials

Now, We are in the process of seting up some tutorials for everyone to try. In the "Tutorials" Folder you'll find different Tutorials to try. For this, we will not be covering how to create a repository (repo), only using an established one. If you want to learn more (or different) information, go to the [Additional Resources](#addition-resources) section. 

**Getting Started** 

 - Download Git
 
 - Download GitHub Desktop
 
 - Make GitHub Account (because that's where AERO stores all our code)
 
 - Create a Git folder on your computer. By convention (and organization) I recommend creating a "GitHub" folder in your "Documents". 

 - Do Some Tutorials

    - [GitHub Desktop](Tutorials/1_GitHub_GettingStarted.md)

    - [VSCode](Tutorials/1_VSCode_GettingStarted.md)

    - [Terminal](Tutorials/1_Terminal_GettingStarted.md)

# Additional Resources

This guide cannot hope to cover all the information. Here are some external tutorials and videos to get you up to speed. If you find other resources that you want to share with others, add them here (using your new knowledge of git commands!)
